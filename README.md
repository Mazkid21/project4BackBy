## Tech

Angular 4 - Front end frame work,

Firebase - Database/Authentication/whole backend 

Bulma - Design library 

Avatars.adorable.io - Avatars...duh

## Approach 

I started this project out with a lot of ideas but was not sure how to accomplosh them and what tools to use. 

I ended up using Angualr for my front end. I wanted to keep working with Angular as I was starting to feel comfortable with it after project 3. 

Starting out I thought using a SQL database would be the best option for the way I wanted to layout my data. After talking with a few folks about Firebase I decided to take an adveture and try out FireBase. 

Firebase....At first I really struggled understanding how Firebase works or even what it could do. I started probably 3 versions of my project with it but trashed them all. I eneded up finding the perfect tutorial (that was up to date as angularfire2 just released version 4.0 and most tutorials / documentaiton was on previous versions) for what I wanted to do. Even with the help from the tutorial it took a good deal of trial and error (lots of practice apps!) to get it going. Once I started getting the hang of it though things just started flying by! I LOVE FIREBASE!!!! 

Bulma... For every Angular project I have done I have struggled with the layout / design because I could not get bootstrap or materialize working. Thats where Bulma came it. It is very similar to bootstrap or materialize but it actually works with Angular! The best part about it is it makes responsive design suppppper easy. Just add some classes to your elements and BAM responsive app out of the box!
